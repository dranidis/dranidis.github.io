I am **Dimitris Dranidis**, a Principal Software Engineer, Quality Architect, and a Computer Science Educator.

Passionate about quality, I focus on clean architecture, test-driven development, model-based and contract testing, and continuous improvement. I have extensive experience refactoring complex systems, integrating quality monitoring platforms, and building tools that enhance reliability, maintainability, and developer productivity. As a mentor and collaborator, I cultivate a cross-team quality culture, support professional growth, and contribute to both open-source software and academic research, consistently delivering maintainable, high-quality solutions across enterprise and educational environments.

I’m also a programming language polyglot, comfortable across functional, logic, object-oriented, procedural, and concurrent paradigms. My experience spans Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Scala, Clojure, ClojureScript, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Prolog, SML, and CML, allowing me to choose the right tool for each problem and guide teams in adopting the most suitable technology stacks and programming styles.
