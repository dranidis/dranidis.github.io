StudentUML is a UML diagram tool for students. The main characteristics of the tool are:

- simplicity
- consistency checking

The tool has been developed by several CITY college students and then maintained and further developed by me.

StudentUML is written in Java as a Swing desktop application. Prolog is used for declaring the rules for consistency checking.
